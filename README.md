# NHL-Data-Exploration

Final project for Data Science class at Villanova University. I chose to explore kaggle datasets: https://www.kaggle.com/martinellis/nhl-game-data

Data was explored using R in an RMarkdown file. For shot location data, I used ggrink() as a ggplot add on which was created by https://github.com/mtthwastn. The RMarkdown files was knitted to a word file for ease of readability.

Presented findings to portion of the class with the powerpoint slides above.
